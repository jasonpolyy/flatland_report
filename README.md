# Flatland Challenge

This repo used to contain the reference code for an assignment submission for the Flatland challenge.

However as I'm aware my report is now being used as an example report given to students for the unit, I've removed all the code.

Nonetheless this demonstrates Time Expanded A-Star, Safe Interval Path Planning, Large Neighbourhood Search (in MAPF contexts with random neighbourhoods) along with an attempt at a domain specific replan mechanism.
All details explained in the report_flatland.pdf.
